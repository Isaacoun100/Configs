# Configs
This repository will host my config files, some important files that I need, and a readme file that willl document this new Linux journey where I will be migrating completely

First things first. I will be using [EndeavourOS]( https://endeavouros.com/ ) as my Linux distro because it's Arch based and because it provides a level of control to the user that other distros don't
The real challenge of this journey is that I plan to work and game from this machine, For the last 6 years I've daily driven Linux for personal use and work, however, gaming, that's an entire different beast that I hope to be able to tame.
I will be listing the packages and tweaks so that if in the future for some reason I need to do this again to not stop from 0

## Timeshift
This is one of those package I cannot live without, It allows me to confidently change and tweak aspects of my system without the fear of accidently bricking my system. Quoting the wiki

> Timeshift helps create incremental snapshots of the file system at regular intervals, which can then be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system.

It can be installed directly from the Arch repository ``` sudo pacman -S timeshift ```
